## Facilities

We operate in two main laboratory rooms that are specific to our group. The Atomic Manipulation room is located in the 4W building, underneath the coffee shop and houses 2 room-temperature ultrahigh vacuum STMs with state-of-the-art automation. The sample characterisation room is located in the main Physics building 3W and contains an optics bench, a multipurpose benchtop AFM, and a set-up for working with on-chip optical devices. We also have access to numerous shared facilities, that include a optical fibre fabrication tower, multiphoton microscope, TEM, SEM, and a nanofabricaiton facility.

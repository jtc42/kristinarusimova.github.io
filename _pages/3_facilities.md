We operate in two main laboratory rooms that are specific to our group. The Atomic Manipulation room is located in the 4W building, underneath the coffee shop and homes 2 room-temperature ultrahigh vacuum STMs with state-of-the-art automation. The sample characterisation room is located in the main Physics building 3W and contains an optics bench, a multipurpose benchtop AFM, and a set-up for working with on-chip devices. We also have access to numerous shared facilities, that include a multiphoton microscope, TEM, SEM, AFM and a Nanofabricaiton Facility.

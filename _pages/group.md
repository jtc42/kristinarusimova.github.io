      <span class="description">I obtained my PhD in atomic manipulation with the scanning tunnelling microscope from the University of Bath in 2016. Following a short postdoctoral position in photonics, I joined the Department of Physics at the University of Bath as an independent Prize Fellow in 2018 and as a tenured Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in 2021. In 2022 I was part of the team awarded the Royal Society of Chemistryâ€™s Faraday Division Horizon Prize for the discovery of chiroptical harmonic scattering. My research interests include single molecule manipulation, quantum optics, advanced materials, and speciality optical fibres.</span>

## Facilities

We operate in two main laboratory rooms that are specific to our group. The Atomic Manipulation room is located in the 4W building, underneath the coffee shop and houses 2 room-temperature ultrahigh vacuum STMs with state-of-the-art automation. The sample characterisation room is located in the main Physics building 3W and contains an optics bench, a multipurpose benchtop AFM, and a set-up for working with on-chip optical devices. We also have access to numerous shared facilities, that include a optical fibre fabrication tower, multiphoton microscope, TEM, SEM, and a nanofabricaiton facility.

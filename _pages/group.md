      <span class="title">Pieter Keenan, PhD student</span>
      <span class="description">Pieter obtained a BSc in Natural Sciences (Physics with Chemistry) from the University of Bath in 2021 and has also spent two years in Bristol undertaking particle physics research as part of the DUNE and SiD collaborations. He is excited to be back in Bath and to be combining the particle coding habits with the physics and chemistry while working with the STMs. He is aiming to establish coupled measurement of light emission and atomic manipulation, enhanced with spectroscopic and single-photon correlation capabilities.</span>

      <span class="title">Dr Cameron McGarry, Postdoctoral Researcher</span>
      <span class="description">Cameron’s PhD at Imperial College London was in atomic and molecular physics, and he now brings this expertise to Bath as part of the team investigating fast low-loss optical switching. He is designing and implementing fibre-integrated photonic devices for use in quantum data centres, including switches, low-loss interconnects to hollow core fibre, and heralded single-photon sources.</span>

      <span class="title">Dr Paramita Pal, Postdoctoral Researcher</span>
      <span class="description">I joined the University of Bath in 2023 as a postdoctoral research associate to work on fibre-integrated technologies for next-generation mobile communications on a collaborative project with British Telecom. During my PhD, I worked on silicon photonics, in particular on the fabrication of rare-earth (erbium) doped silicon, silica-on-silicon substrates to build a planar waveguide platform for an integrated waveguide amplifier (EDWA) using Ultrafast Laser Plasma doping (ULPD) at the University of Leeds. I received my BSc and MSc degrees in physics from Jadavpur University, Kolkata, India. I have done several internships, working on micro pattern gaseous detectors (MPGDs) in CERN, Switzerland, in Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics (SINP), Kolkata, India and on multi crystalline silicon wafer solar cells in SERIS, National University of Singapore (NUS), Singapore.</span>

      <span class="title">Dr Kristina Rusimova, Assistant Professor (Lecturer)</span>
      <span class="description">I obtained my PhD in atomic manipulation with the scanning tunnelling microscope from the University of Bath in 2016. Following a short postdoctoral position in photonics, I joined the Department of Physics at the University of Bath as an independent Prize Fellow in 2018 and as a tenured Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in 2021. In 2022 I was part of the team awarded the Royal Society of Chemistry’s Faraday Division Horizon Prize for the discovery of chiroptical harmonic scattering. My research interests include single molecule manipulation, quantum optics, advanced materials, and speciality optical fibres.</span>

## Facilities

We operate in two main laboratory rooms that are specific to our group. The Atomic Manipulation room is located in the 4W building, underneath the coffee shop and houses 2 room-temperature ultrahigh vacuum STMs with state-of-the-art automation. The sample characterisation room is located in the main Physics building 3W and contains an optics bench, a multipurpose benchtop AFM, and a set-up for working with on-chip optical devices. We also have access to numerous shared facilities, that include a optical fibre fabrication tower, multiphoton microscope, TEM, SEM, and a nanofabricaiton facility.

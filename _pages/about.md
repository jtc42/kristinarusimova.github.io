We are an experimental physics research lab at the University of Bath that focuses on studying the ways in which light and matter interact on the atomic scale.

Our expertise is in using a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) to manipulate matter on the atomic scale and in using optical techniques to study the nonlinear interactions between light and low dimensional nanomaterials. Through precise automated measurements we aim to gain information about the behaviour of single electrons, photons and molecules on the surface of silicon, in 2D materials and in organic molecular crystals. We seek out new understanding of the nanoscale physical processes that underpin light emission and single molecule reactions. In addition to fundamental research, we also do more applied science to study the interactions between light and alkali metal atoms for use in quantum optical applications.

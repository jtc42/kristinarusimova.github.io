My current focus is on the development of more comprehensive control and automation software for the OpenFlexure Microscope.

This project uses the OpenFlexure Microscope design to provide accurate and high-throughput diagnosis for Malaria in ODA countries. Malaria affects hundreds of millions of people per year, and is often diagnosed with manual microscopy, which is labour-intensive and hard to quality-control. We are building on our open source hardware designs to develop low cost, fully automated microscope hardware that can acquire images consistently and efficiently. The ultimate goal is that these microscopes can be produced locally, building skills and jobs across the developing world, and reducing dependency on expensive, slow, and unreliable supply chains.

### Principal Investigator: Open, 3D printed fluorescence microscopy for cell imaging

*£3000 funding awarded from EPSRC 'Reimagining Recruitment' project*

Fluorescence microscopy is an essential research tool in biology, from imaging single molecules, to cell biology and whole tissues. However, practical exposure to fluorescence microscopy in the undergraduate curriculum is limited, largely due to cost. Although commercial fluorescence microscopes are available, they are prohibitively expensive for undergraduate teaching laboratories. We are building on the OpenFlexure project to produce a laboratory-grade motorised fluorescence microscope with a parts cost of under £500 and a specification exceeding commercially available fluorescence teaching microscopes costing an order of magnitude more. The design will be open-source, allowing the microscope to be used as a prototyping platform for further microscopy developments.

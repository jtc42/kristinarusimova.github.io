Modern nanofabrication techniques have allowed the development of nanostructures whose properties are determined not only by the choice of materials, but also by their geometry. The strong dependence on geometry enables the tailored design of structures exhibiting novel optical properties.

Much of this project has focused on the active development of comprehensive characterisation experiments. Various experimental schemes exist to enhance measurable chioptical (chiral-optical) effects, including nonlinear measurements, diffraction imaging, and microscopy. By developing automated data acquisition and processing, we use these techniques to develop a better understanding of the relationship between nanostructure geometry, and their optical properties.

### Outreach

I have been heavily involved in a fully funded outreach project demonstrating the interesting properties and applications of light in both science and every-day life, aimed at Key Stage 2, year 5 and 6 students. This has involved leading a range of activities in small groups of 5-6 students, as well as leading the overall whole-class session.

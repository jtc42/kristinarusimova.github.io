### YEAR 2020-2021 (PH30036 & PH40065) 

#### Controlling the outcome of single molecule reactions 

**Students: Louis Remington & Jamie Greenwood** 
 
<!--- Much of modern science is built upon our ability not just to “see”, but to “touch” and even “move” individual atoms and molecules. At the heart of this capability is the scanning tunnelling microscope (STM). The original experiments that pioneered atomic manipulation some thirty years ago simply pushed or pulled atoms with the STM tip to spell out atomic adverts, or create quantum corrals. At Bath, we perform manipulation experiments which use the tunnelling electrons from the STM tip to invoke a molecular excitation. It is the natural evolution of the excited molecular state that leads to the final reaction outcome, and so controlling that reaction outcome has not yet been possible. 
 
We recently showed that the STM tip can quench the lifetime of the excited state of molecules inside the STM tunnel junction. Your task will be to push these experiments even further and demonstrate that we can controllably influence the outcome of electron induced molecular reactions. You will use an ultrahigh vacuum STM to perform automated molecular manipulation experiments. Your aim will be not only to detect whether a manipulation event happened or not, but also to measure what happened and how. By investigating the branching ratio of different reaction outcomes as a function of manipulation parameters, you will check if the reaction outcome can be influenced by the manipulation process itself. --->
 
#### Measuring modes in hollow core fibres 

**Student: Danel Gomez Iradi**
 
<!--- Research into new optical fibres requires us to understand the modes of light they guide. One way to measure the mode distribution in fibres is the spatially and spectrally resolved imaging (S2) method. This is based on the different group velocities of the modes, which leads to spectral interference patterns when broadband light propagates along the fibre, and also distinct spatial interference patterns between the fundamental mode and higher-order modes. Your task will be to build such an S2 setup in the lab (see figure below from Nicholson, et al., Opt. Express, 16, 7233 (2008)) and use it to characterise novel designs of optical fibres. 
 
Much of our research centres on hollow-core fibres. While most fibres guide light by total internal reflection in a solid glass core, hollow-core fibres use an intricate cladding microstructure to confine light to an air core. We modify this microstructure to alter the fibre's guiding properties. In particular, we aim to develop fibres with either low-loss single-mode operation, or controllable coupling to higher-order modes and hence an enhanced interaction with the cladding. This is key for applications like surface-enhanced Raman scattering and thermoplasmonics for quantum technologies, across several projects within the Department.  --->

<!---  Over the last 25 years, the telecommunications industry has been revolutionized thanks to the invention of the optical fibre. Optical fibres are made out of thin glass tubes that have been stretched out down to a wire no thicker than a human hair (a hundred microns). These tiny glass wires are capable of confining light and thereby transmitting information thanks to their structure. Typically, they have a radial solid core-cladding structure, where the core region has been doped with germanium to increase its refractive index. The light is confined to the core for several kilometres due to a mechanism called total internal reflection.   
 
Although standard fibres helped us to achieve so many advances in a very wide range of disciplines, they have their limits. For example, in telecommunications, we are reaching a  capacity crunch as we have reached the maximum amount of data that can be transmitted  simultaneously through a standard  telecom optical fibre. Here in Bath, we are investigating a new type of fibres called hollow-core fibres. These fibres have been recognized to have potential to realise the lowest loss ever measured and therefore could become game-changers in the telecommunications industry. In contrast to standard fibres, in hollow-core fibres, the light is guided in the air. This is achieved due to the structure of the fibre which consists of a ring of 6 silica capillaries around the hollow core. The thin walls of the capillaries act as resonators, confining the light in the hollow core over a range of wavelengths.   
 
For practical applications, one important property that optical fibres must have is the ability to maintain the polarisation state of light. Such fibres are called polarisation maintaining fibres and they have the ability to propagate only one polarisation state of light. This is extremely useful for a range of applications (for example in optical modulators, amplifiers and interferometers).   Similar behaviour can be achieved in the hollow-core fibres by introducing different types of resonators.  
 
The aim of the project is to build an experimental setup that can be used to characterise the polarisation properties of hollow-core fibres and investigate the effects of the surrounding structure on different exotic designs of these fibres. If successful, this work will be the first demonstration of birefringence exhibited by this new generation of anti-resonant hollow-core fibres. --->
 
### Spectroscopy of two-dimensional materials via optical fibres 

**Students: Thomas Street & Rosey Fort**

Laboratory of Prof Daniel Wolverson 
 
<!--- Since the isolation of graphene, two-dimensional materials have attracted enormous attention worldwide; they offer the ability to decrease the size of semiconductor devices below the present limits, to make completely new types of device, and to move device architectures into three dimensions by controlled layering. However, there are around 1000 candidate two dimensional materials and their properties are only now being mapped out in enough detail to realise these ambitions.

The project students will join the Nanoscience Group in Bath, which has pioneered the study of one particular family of 2D materials, based on ReS2 and ReSe2. These are highly unusual compared to more well-known 2D materials (e.g, MoS2) and offer a rich playground for fundamental nanoscience. One of our aims is to study atomically thin layers at low T and high magnetic fields, but it is difficult to locate microscopic samples in a conventional superconducting magnet. 

This project will explore solutions to this problem using optical fibres with a 2D material placed across the fibre tip (using a printing technique available in our lab). This will allow the immersion of the sample into cryogenic liquids, cryostats or magnets without the need for low-temperature microscopy. The top figure (left) shows possible arrangements for studying (a) transmission and (b) luminescence in a range of 2D materials this way, including MoS2 and ReS2. In addition, the availability of speciality optical fibres through the Centre for Photonics and Photonic Materials will allow us to explore possible solutions to removing the strong silica background which would normally be present in such a setup by using custom optical fibres and devices which are otherwise not available to purchase commercially. --->

### YEAR 2015-16 (PH30036 & PH40065) 

#### Regulating the femtosecond excited-state lifetime of a single molecule 

**Students: Ruairidh Howes & Frank Lee** 

Laboratory of Dr Peter Sloan 

Published Papers:

(1) Regulating the femtosecond excited-state lifetime of a single molecule, K. R. Rusimova, R. M. Purkiss, R. Howes, F. Lee, S. Crampin, and P. A. Sloan, Science, 361 (6406), 1012-1016 (2018) 
 
<!--- The key to controlling reactions of molecules induced with the current of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) tip is the ultrashort intermediate excited ionic state. The initial condition of the excited state is set by the energy and position of the injected current; thereafter, its dynamics determines the reaction outcome. We show that a STM can directly and controllably influence the excited-state dynamics. For the STM-induced desorption of toluene molecules from the Si(111)-7x7 surface, as the tip approaches the molecule, the probability of manipulation drops by two orders of magnitude. A two-channel quenching of the excited state is proposed, consisting of an invariant surface channel and a tip height–dependent channel. We conclude that picometer tip proximity regulates the lifetime of the excited state from 10 femtoseconds to less than 0.1 femtoseconds. --->
 
### YEAR 2014-15 (PH30036 & PH40065) 

#### Initiating and imaging the coherent surface dynamics of charge carriers in real space 

**Students: Nicola Bannister & Patrick Harrison** 

Laboratory of Dr Peter Sloan 

Published Papers: 

(1) Initiating and imaging the coherent surface dynamics of charge carriers in real space, K. R. Rusimova, N. Bannister, P. Harrison, D. Lock, S. Crampin, R. E. Palmer, and P. A. Sloan, Nature Communications, 7, 12839 (2016) 
 
<!--- The tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope is an atomic-scale source of electrons and holes. As the injected charge spreads out, it can induce adsorbed molecules to react. By comparing large-scale ‘before’ and ‘after’ images of an adsorbate covered surface, the spatial extent of the nonlocal manipulation is revealed. Here, we measure the nonlocal manipulation of toluene molecules on the Si(111)-7 × 7 surface at room temperature. Both the range and probability of nonlocal manipulation have a voltage dependence. A region within 5–15 nm of the injection site shows a marked reduction in manipulation. We propose that this region marks the extent of the initial coherent (that is, ballistic) time-dependent evolution of the injected charge carrier. Using scanning tunnelling spectroscopy, we develop a model of this time-dependent expansion of the initially localized hole wavepacket within a particular surface state and deduce a quantum coherence (ballistic) lifetime of ∼10 fs. --->
